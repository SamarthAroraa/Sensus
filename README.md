# Sensus
# Branch for Hackathon
Sensus is a web based journal that is like any other journal, except that it uses Natural Language Processing to gage the sentiments of the writer and log it on a calender, mapping it with colors and emojis. The user can, look back at the entries years later and get a sense of how they felt during the time.
Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. Sensus can also be used as an early detection tool for depression and stress.
Our policy  is to keep Sensus as unopinionated as possible. We provide the user with analytics and and statistics on their happiness quotient.

**We at Sensus aim to build a better, happier, more introspective future!**
